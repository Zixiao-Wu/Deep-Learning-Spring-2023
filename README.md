# **DAT 565E: Deep Learning Spring 2023**

## **Course Description:**

The course teaches students to build deep learning models for solving business problems using python libraries (e.g., Keras, TensorFlow, etc.). It covers a range of algorithms from neural networks foundations, to convolutional and recurrent network structures. The course will expose students to prevalent business applications of deep learning in different domains (Customer Analytics, Supply Chain Analytics, Healthcare Analytics, Financial Technology Analytics, Accounting Analytics, Talent Analytics, etc.). Upon completing this course, students will know how to build and optimize deep learning models for different business applications.

## **Main Topics:**

1. Fundamentals of Deep Neural Networks; Applying Neural Network Models for Tabular Data Classification;
2. Optimizing Deep Neural Networks; Applying Neural Network Models for Tabular Data Regression;
3. Deep Learning for Computer Vision; Applying Convolutional Neural Networks for Computer Vision;
4. Applying Sequential Models for Text Analysis; Fundamentals of Recurrent Neural Networks; 
5. Intro to Self-Supervised Learning and Generative Models; Applying Self-Supervised Learning for Clustering;

## **Learning Objectives:**

1. Understand neural networks and how to optimize their performance.
2. Understand what the deep learning model is, and how to use it in business.
3. Understand what the deep learning model structure should be used for a given business problem.
4. Visualize and analyze unstructured datasets.
5. Apply the deep learning models to gain insights from business problems.
